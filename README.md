# Gamious-Bot
Private Discord bot named "Gamious", used as an introduction to learning Python and for personal use for myself and friends.

## Commands
Commands are done using the prefix `=`:
- `=calc <expression>`: calculates any math expression using `eval()`.
- `=coinflip`: sends "Heads!" or "Tails!". 
- `=dice <# dices> <# sides>`: returns total of dice roll.
- `=dog` or `=dog <breed>`: sends a picture of a random/chosen breed of dog.
- `=github`: simply links back to this page.
- `=help`: basically gives the exact same list of commands and uses as seen here (from Github). 
- `/loldle`: sends the LoLdle link. 
- `=ping` or `/ping`: returns "pong!" with latency.
- `=poll -question -option 1 -option2`: spaced apart using `-` with 2-10 option limit.
- `=profile @mention`: returns the discord avatar of the @mention'd user. 
- `=sort`: sorts a set of numbers/words in order. 
- `=sortr`: sorts a set of numbers/words in reverse-order.
