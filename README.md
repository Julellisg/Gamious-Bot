# Gamious-Bot
Private Discord bot named "Gamious", used as an introduction to learning Python and for personal use for myself and friends.

## Commands
Commands are done using the prefix `=`:
- `=ping` or `/ping`: returns "pong!" with latency.
- `=poll -question -option 1 -option2`: spaced apart using `-` with 2-10 option limit.
- `=profile @mention`: returns the discord avatar of the @mention'd user. 
- `=flip`: sends "Heads!" or "Tails!". 
- `=uptime`: send current uptime of the bot since it has gone online.
- `=calc <expression>`: calculates any math expression using `eval()`.
- `=github`: simply links back to this page.

### TODO (maybe)

- Auto responses
- Reminders/Set timed messages

- ~~Some word sorter~~
